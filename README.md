# Go-Chase-It

This project is a part of the Udacity's "Robotics Software Nano-degree" program. The goal of this project is to get to know about the basics of ROS. In this project, a robot has been designed and placed inside a simulation and the task of the robot is to chase/follow a white colored ball. Following are the main objectives: 

1. Understanding and creating a urdf file for a 2-wheel differential drive robot. Understand how a Gazebo model is interfaced with a simulation through Gazebo plugins. 
2. Creating ROS nodes. Define publishers and subscribers. Write ROS services for specific tasks.
3. Learning how to include multiple sensors and analyze the data in RViz.
